# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

## About
The rock paper scissors lizard spock game is a fun game for kids or adults to see if they can beat the computer. Tha aim of the game is to make a choice of weapon that beats the computer's weapon. Similar to a game played as kids or a decider to who goes first for adults.

This game comes with 5 different options to choose from (see title of the game). This means that each option now has 2 weaknesses instead of just one. It also mean that it has strength over 2 options. This makes it a bit more interesting and makes the user think more strategically.

## Design 
I wanted to pick a theme that suggested old school science and computers since the game comes from the Tv Show 'The Big Bang Theory' which is a comedy sitcom based on science.

### Colour Scheme
The color scheme is picked:

Neon Green #39ff14





## Features
The design of the website was to have 2 pages. A Home/Landing page, to explain the game, and the Game page.

### Home Page
The home page has a landing image which displays the flow of the game. It shows which weapons beat other weapons. There is information about the game and a list of confirming which weapons beat others. I have also put a table in showing which weapons are superior over others to simplify it for the user as there are a few variations to remember.
